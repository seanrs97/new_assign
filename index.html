This is your starting point...<p class=style2>The best way to start University is to<br class=mobile-hide>be open minded, organised and most importantly YOURSELF!!<p class=style3>University can be a daunting prospect for even the most confident and intelligent people so being anxious is completely normal. The best way to start university is to prepare for what you think may be a problem for you. By following the steps below, your preperation should be near complete!!<ul><li class="fa icon icon-center largeIcon fa-book"><li><strong>Step 1 - Research the course that you have chosen.</strong> This may appear very obvious, but this is one trick that many fail to do. Researching the content that you will be covering for the rest of the year is one of the most important steps that you can take to advance your overall learning experience at university. Not only will give you an advantage over the other students, but it will also give you knowledge prior to being taught it, meaning you won't have to learn a million new things in the short space of the year!<li class="fa icon icon-center largeIcon fa-map"><li><strong>Step 2 - Get to know the area.</strong> If you're moving to a new location to study like many students do, then it's probably a good idea to know the surroundings of the place you'll be living for a year. A good idea would be to check out the universities website and check to see where all the buildings and campuses are located and how to get there . The same can be said about the city too! If you're going to be living there, you're going to want to venture off of campus a bit, so why not have a walk around the city or town and find out where everything is.<li class="fa icon icon-center largeIcon fa-users"><li><strong>Step 3 - Make yourself some friends.</strong> Social life plays a big role of a university students life, and if you're going to a university full of unfamilar faces, then it may seem impossible to have any kind of social life. But worry not, there are many in the same boat as you, and they're all as anxious as you are, so you're not alone. The best way to get out and make some friends is to join a club! Joining a club will not only help you meet new people, but it will also give you something to do in your spare time. If however, you're not interested in any of the universites clubs, the best thing to do, is simply talk to people! they won't bite you and if anything they'll understand your position and welcome you to talk to them.<li class="fa icon icon-center largeIcon fa-home"><li><strong>Step 4 - Get yourself a place to live! </strong>Perhaps this should be higher up on the list, because having a roof over your head is pretty darn important!! But that's not important, what is important, is finding a place to live! Most first year students will find solace in the halls of residence that will likely be very close to the university. These are simply halls of room occupied by students, this is defintely the option to go for if you're a socialite or want to make some friends. If however, you prefer things a bit quieter with less people, then a rented house is probably the way to go. Most universites will have a university zone for students to live in, where you will have the oppurtunity to live in a shared house with other students or even on your own if you like!<li class="fa icon icon-center largeIcon fa-smile-o"><li><strong>Step 5 - Remember to enjoy yourself! </strong>This is perhaps the most important step of all, just behind getting a good degree of course... university is a once in a life experience and is likely the last real chance that many people will have to really enjoy themselves before they are welcomed into the harsh reality of THE WORLD!! So whatever you do, enjoy yourself, party and have a good time... and of course get a degree at the end of it.</ul><h2>Now you're ready to go into the crazy world that is University!!</h2></section></div><div class="wrapper style2"><div class=title>Study Life</div><div class=container id=main><section id=features><header class=style1><h2>This is the reason you came here!</h2><p>So it's important you know how to get the best out of your brain!</header><div class=feature-list><div class=row><div class="12u(mobile) 6u"><section><h3 class="fa icon fa-book"aria-hidden=true>Methods of Studying</h3><p>Decide what works best for you when studying. If you're a social person than perhaps working in a group of people will benefit your learning outcomes, if not then working alone is probably the best way for you. Along with this, you also have the choice of working in a quiet enviroment, or a louder one (perhaps with music?) again, this all comes down to preference, so it really is up to the indivudal themself.</section></div><div class="12u(mobile) 6u"><section><h3 class="fa icon fa-tree">Where to Study</h3><p>You pretty much have the world at your oyster when it comes to studying.. but some places are better than others. The library is probably the best place to go, as you'll find most of the resources you need in a quiet enviroment. If however, you prefer your own company, then study at home if possible! or if it's a nice day, take a stroll and find a nice place to sit and study.</section></div></div><div class=row><div class="12u(mobile) 6u"><section><h3 class="fa icon fa-times">Things to Avoid</h3><p>Don't overdo or underdo it! Studying is an art that needs to be mastered. It is very easy to commit yourself to a full day of work but in reality, after a few hours, your brain probably would have turned to mush. The same can be said for underdoing work, it is very important to do work when you have it, or else you're just going to find it harder to complete. So find your balance, and do work in moderation.</section></div><div class="12u(mobile) 6u"><section><h3 class="fa icon fa-cloud">Some Final Tips</h3><p>Get plenty of rest and don't party before studying! This is probably the worst thing you can do if you have an assignment due soon and have a lot of work to do. Drinking heavy or not sleeping much will not only slow your thought processes, but it will also leave you sleepy and drowsy for the forseeing future. So maybe save the partying and late nights for when you're in the clear on your assignments.</section></div></div></div></section></div></div><div class="wrapper style3"id=socialLife><div class=title>Social Life</div><div class=container id=highlights><header class=style1><h2>Okay so this is the real reason you came here!</h2><p>Studying is important but what's hard work without a bit of fun?</header><div class="row 150%"><div class="12u(mobile) 4u"><section class=highlight><a href=# class="featured image"><img alt="Image of University"src=images/indexImage1.webp></a><h3><a href=#>Join a Club or Society</a></h3><p>Joining a club or society with gith you a great oppurtunity to do something you enjoy with people you have probably never met before.
