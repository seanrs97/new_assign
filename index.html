						<p class="style1">Still don't have a clue what you're doing? This is your starting point...</p>
						<p class="style2">
							The best way to start University is to<br class="mobile-hide" />
							be open minded, organised and most importantly YOURSELF!!
						</p>
						<p class="style3"> University can be a daunting prospect for even the most confident and intelligent people
										   so being anxious is completely normal. The best way to start university is to prepare for what
										   you think may be a problem for you. By following the steps below, your preperation should be near 
										   complete!!</p>
						<ul>
							<h3 class="icon fa fa-book "></h3><li> <strong>Step 1 - Research the course that you have chosen.</strong> This may appear very obvious, but this is one trick
								 that many fail to do. Researching the content that you will be covering for the rest of the year is one 
								 of the most important steps that you can take to advance your overall learning experience at university. Not
								 only will give you an advantage over the other students, but it will also give you knowledge prior to being
								 taught it, meaning you won't have to learn a million new things in the short space of the year!</li>
							<h3 class="icon fa fa-map icon-center"></h3><li> <strong>Step 2 - Get to know the area.</strong> If you're moving to a new location to study like many students do, then
								 it's probably a good idea to know the surroundings of the place you'll be living for a year. A good idea would be 
								 to check out the universities website and check to see where all the buildings and campuses are located and how to get there
							     . The same can be said about the city too! If you're going to be living there, you're going to want to venture off of campus
								 a bit, so why not have a walk around the city or town and find out where everything is.</li>
						   <h3 class="icon fa fa-users icon-center"></h3> <li> <strong> Step 3 - Make yourself some friends.</strong> Social life plays a big role of a university students life, and if you're
								going to a university full of unfamilar faces, then it may seem impossible to have any kind of social life. But worry not, there
								are many in the same boat as you, and they're all as anxious as you are, so you're not alone. The best way to get out and make 
								some friends is to join a club! Joining a club will not only help you meet new people, but it will also give you something to do
								in your spare time. If however, you're not interested in any of the universites clubs, the best thing to do, is simply talk to people!
								they won't bite you and if anything they'll understand your position and welcome you to talk to them. </li>
							<h3 class="icon fa fa-home icon-center"></h3><li> <strong> Step 4 - Get yourself a place to live! </strong> Perhaps this should be higher up on the list, because having a roof over your 
								head is pretty darn important!! But that's not important, what is important, is finding a place to live! Most first year students
								will find solace in the halls of residence that will likely be very close to the university. These are simply halls of room occupied by
								students, this is defintely the option to go for if you're a socialite or want to make some friends. If however, you prefer things a 
								bit quieter with less people, then a rented house is probably the way to go. Most universites will have a university zone for students
								to live in, where you will have the oppurtunity to live in a shared house with other students or even on your own if you like!</li>
							<h3 class="icon fa fa-smile-o icon-center"></h3><li> <strong> Step 5 - Remember to enjoy yourself! </strong> This is perhaps the most important step of all, just behind getting a good degree of course...
								university is a once in a life experience and is likely the last real chance that many people will have to really enjoy themselves before
								they are welcomed into the harsh reality of THE WORLD!! So whatever you do, enjoy yourself, party and have a good time... and of course get 
								a degree at the end of it.</li>

												<h3 class="icon fa fa-book"  aria-hidden="true">Methods of Studying</h3>
												<p>Decide what works best for you when studying. If you're a social person than perhaps working in a group of people will benefit 
												   your learning outcomes, if not then working alone is probably the best way for you. Along with this, you also have the choice of
												   working in a quiet enviroment, or a louder one (perhaps with music?) again, this all comes down to preference, so it really 
												   is up to the indivudal themself.</p></p>
											</section>
										</div>

											<section>
												<h3 class="icon fa fa-tree">Where to Study</h3>
												<p>You pretty much have the world at your oyster when it comes to studying.. but some places are better than others. The library is probably
												   the best place to go, as you'll find most of the resources you need in a quiet enviroment. If however, you prefer your own company, then 
												   study at home if possible! or if it's a nice day, take a stroll and find a nice place to sit and study.</p>

											<section>
												<h3 class="icon fa fa-times">Things to Avoid</h3>
												<p>Don't overdo or underdo it! Studying is an art that needs to be mastered. It is very easy to commit yourself to a full day of work
												   but in reality, after a few hours, your brain probably would have turned to mush. The same can be said for underdoing work, it is 
												   very important to do work when you have it, or else you're just going to find it harder to complete. So find your balance, and do
												   work in moderation.</p>
											</section>
										</div>
										<div class="6u 12u(mobile)">
											<section>
												<h3 class="icon fa fa-cloud">Some Final Tips</h3>
												<p> Get plenty of rest and don't party before studying! This is probably the worst thing you can do if you have an assignment due soon 
													and have a lot of work to do. Drinking heavy or not sleeping much will not only slow your thought processes, but it will also leave
													you sleepy and drowsy for the forseeing future. So maybe save the partying and late nights for when you're in the clear on your 
													assignments.</p>
